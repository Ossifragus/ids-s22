# Exercises

1. Write a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through
   simulation. The function takes two arguments `ndoors` and
   `ntrials`, representing the number of doors in the experiment and
   the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function
   should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and
   no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors,
   both with 1000 trials.

1. Write a function to do a Monte Carlo approximation of $\pi$. The
   function takes a Monte Carlo sample size `n` as input, and returns
   a point estimate of $\pi$ and a 95% confidence interval. Apply your
   function with sample size 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000. Comment on
   the results.

1. Find the first 10-digit prime number occurring in consecutive
   digits of $e$. This was a
